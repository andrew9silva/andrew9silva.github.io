I decided on this path sitting at my desk, having another unfulfilling day, sitting there feeling unsatisfied.  While I appreciate the people I work for and truly believe I work for a company with the best intentions, however, that doesn't change my personal views on how work and ife should be.

I have always been fascinated by things being built, whether a car, road, skyscraper, etc.  Once I entered the workforce jobs in those fields either did not provide the life I wanted (low pay, very long and hard hours) or required some skill I had failed to acquire, which led me down the path I am currently on (I am in Operations management at the moment).  

While doing a typical mundane job search, I kept seeing postings in software in my city (Denver) and looked into it more.  Software will provide everything I am looking for in life - the potential for great flexibility and a chance to actually build something from the bottom up.

So far I have enjoyed this course and what it has shown and look forward to continuing it.
