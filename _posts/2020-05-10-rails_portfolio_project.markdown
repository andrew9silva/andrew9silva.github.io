I found this project to be the "easiest" of the 3 projects I have done so far.  I loved how much more intutive Rails is than the previous projects I have done.  That is not to say the project did not have its challenges.  Numerous times I found my self thinking I had my code exactly as was needed to get the app to perform correctly, but just to find it was not operating as I wanted.  

A great example of this is when I was trying to get validation errors to show when a form was not completed correctly.  I relized the issue was not within the code I had in the form view, but rathe in the controller for each object.  I noticed in my "else" statement for creating the object I had a "redirect_to" and changed it to a "render".  Once that was done my validation errors showed up as I need.

Overall I would say this project was very enjoyable and I am looking forward to Javascript.
