The Sinatra Portfolio propfect is certainly one I was looking forward to.  Not only did I need to create functioning programming to actually run the application, but I also had the opportunity to design the layout/look of the application with HTML and CSS.

I did run into a couple challenges, specifically with getting my comments about a team to post to that same team's page and not to all the team pages. I realized I was making a simple mistake between the name of my controller and the ID of the input for in the form.  Once that was sqaured away I was able to have my comments posting to the correct team.

I found this project to be more fulfilling than the previous CLI project.  I previously mentioned the HTML and the CSS allowing me add the visual design element to my application, but it also provides a more well rounded experience to what programming is.  Getting to be the user and trying to satisfy myself with the visuals gave me a new appreciation for what the front end developers need to go through, not just the back end.
